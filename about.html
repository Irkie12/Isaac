<h1>About Brownie</h1>
<p>Brownie is my gerbil from my cousins.</p>
<p>She was born on 22nd June 2021.</p>
<p>My cousins keep gerbils and they bred them, the girls in one cage and the boys in another. But then her aunt started to kick Brownie out. So along we came down to them and I took Brownie with me. Brownie has a brother called Fudge still with my cousins (nevermind he died).</p>

<p>Very sadly Brownie died on the 15th September 2023 after living for two years and 3 months.</p>

<p>May she rest in peace.</p>
