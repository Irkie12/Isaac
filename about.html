<h1>About Brownie</h1>
<p>Brownie is my gerbil from Bath.</p>
<p>My cousins keep gerbils and they bred them, the girls in one cage and the boys in another. But then her aunt started to kick Brownie out. So along we came down to Bath and i took Brownie with me. Brownie has a brother called Fudge still in Bath.</p>
